if the quality texture doesn't exist, it will use texture that close to normal quality.
if the normal quality texture still doesn't exist, it will use default(original) texture.

so, the building from other mods that doesn't have quality texture is compatible.




naming rule:

[filename]_Quality0 => Awful or Poor
[filename]_Quality1 => Poor 
[filename]_Quality2 => Normal or Good
[filename]_Quality3 => Good
[filename]_Quality4 => Excellent or Masterwork or Legendary
[filename]_Quality5 => Masterwork
[filename]_Quality6 => Legendary

for Graphic_Random(Graphic_Multy) class like sculptures: 
Quality_[foldername]/[filename]_Quality0
Quality_[foldername]/[filename]_Quality1
...
